# Dimension-Estimation
A survey and code for dimension estimation methods

We provide a brief survey of some results about dimension estimation of the intrinsic dimension of a data set. In particular, we describe the methods of Costa, Girotra and Hero as well as those of Kleindessner and von Luxburg. The latter authors present algorithms which do not require any measurements of distances between points in the data set, although for the sake of simplicity we still evaluate these distances when writing the example code. The work presented was my part of a collaborative project with Shereen Elaidi on the topic of dimension reduction and dimension estimation, for the graduate statistics course Math 680 (Computationally Intensive Stats) at McGill University, taken with Prof. Russell Steele.
